For my lab 4 project, I made a choropleth map of the number of ski resorts per state. I got the data from 2022 on a website called "On the Snow," and using the excel sheet provided from the choropleth example map as a template, I changed the quantitative data for each state to their amount of ski resorts. The state with the least amount of resorts is Tennessee with 1 , and the state with the highest amount of resorts is New York with 52. The structure of the index file is mostly from the template provided from the choropleth example map, with some minor changes to styling, feature property names, and attributions. The biggest changes / additions are the legend and description. I got help from online tutorials and other google searches on how to set up the legend, and the description I used code from the previous lab.
